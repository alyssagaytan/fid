<h2>Low and Slow</h2>
<p>This week I am extremely excited about a new cooking technique called <b>sous vide.</b> In <dfn>sous vide cooking</dfn>, you submerge the food <small>(usually vacuum-sealed in plastic)</small> into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching.</q></p>

<p>Next month, we will be serving Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before <time dateline="10-30">November 30.<</time></p>
